  caveats <<~EOS
    flow-bar is a companion to the `flow` CLI — install it from
    https://github.com/Facets-cloud/flow and make sure it's on your PATH.

    This build is not yet notarized, so macOS Gatekeeper will block the first
    launch. Allow it with:

      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "#{appdir}/flow-bar.app"

    then open flow-bar again.
